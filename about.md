I'm a software engineer who is very passionate about the free and open-source development, and the open-source community in general. I love coding, especially in C/C++, and problem solving. Besides coding, I love listening to post rock, as well as, psychedelic rock music, also I tend to play guitar from time to time, although, I haven't played it in a while :)
