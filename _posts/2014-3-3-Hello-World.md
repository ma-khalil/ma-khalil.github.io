Hello world! this is my first blog, I'm really interested in the open-source community and contributing to open-source software. So I'll be mainly talking about my personal projects, the projects I contribute to, and discussing new things I learn along the way.

So stick around to if you're interested in those stuff too. Also feel free to contact me to discuss any mentioned ideas in the blog posts.
